Generating a Screenshot of a UIView with this small category. It's easy as pie.

Example
-------
``` objective-c
UIView *view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
UIImage *screenshot = [view screenshot];
```

No more thinking about UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(). It's just easy to read and easy to use.
