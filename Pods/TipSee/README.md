### To do:

- [x] Live change
- [x] Touchable target area
- [x] Animating between tips
- [x] Multipe Tip in the screen
- [x] Dim animation
- [x] bubble animation
- [x] multipleTip, one Location
- [ ] it is good for tip to follow it's target area movements

# What we can do with TipSee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can show interactive hints on top of the views or where ever we want but finding the best place to put the bubble (or custom view) is based on the TipSee's decision. it will find best place to show the hint by considering the available space and the content size, smartly. we can show custom views (like that heart) or simple text as you've seen in the Gif. Tips can point to all kind of views like button, images and ... or just a specific part of the view controller(like the hint that points to the center of the view in the gif) 


# How much TipSee is customizable: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two types of config, one for the whole and global things (which will apply to all hints and tips) and one specific configuration for each bubble. **TipSee.Options** is the one we set to have a global configuration for all bubbles and tips and **TipSee.Options.Bubble** which is our configuration for each hint. it means that we can change the background color, font and ... for each tip, or we can just set a general configuration for all hints. so we start with global one:
```swift
public struct Options: HintConfiguration {

    /// default dim's color, each bubble could changes this color(optionaly) by setting the bubble.dimBackgroundColor
    public var dimColor: UIColor

    /// bubble's life cycle.
    /// forEver : bubbles will be visible and needs to be remove manualy by caliing dismiss(item), you can show multiple bubbles same time
    /// untilNext: everytime show() function is called, previous bubble(if exists) will remove and new one will present
    public var bubbleLiveDuration: BubbleLiveDuration

    /// indicates the default bubble's position, each bubble can has specific position by setting bubble.position
    public var defaultBubblePosition: BubblePosition

    /// specifies the hole's(Target Area) radius
    /// keepTargetAreaCornerRadius : uses target view layer corner radius
    /// constantRadius(radius) : sets constant radius for all
    /// defaultOrGreater(default) : sets a constant default value or uses the target view layer corner radius if it is greater that the default value
    /// none : no corner rradius
    public var holeRadius: HoleRadius

    /// indicates bubble's margin with the target area
    public var safeAreaInsets: UIEdgeInsets

    /// if false, the dimTap Callback will not call. some times we need to let users to interact with the views behinde the dim
    public var absorbDimTouch : Bool

    /// if true, dim will fade after one second, combine this with absorbDimTouch if you want to have an interactive area while your hint is showing, by default, a dim will cover all the screen and user can not touch the things behind that dim
    public var dimFading : Bool


    /// bublbe's options. all bubbles will setup by this one if they will have not specified one for themself until presentaion. every bubble can has their own configuration and if we set specific configuration for a hint, that one will apply and this one is ignored
    public var bubbles: Bubble
    
}
```
**Bubble Options**
```swift 
public struct Bubble {
    
    /// bubble's background color
    public  var backgroundColor: UIColor
    
    /// preferred position for the bubble, this is preferred because sometimes there is not enough space there, TipSee needs to choose a better place to put the bubble
    public  var position: BubblePosition?
    
    /// text font
    public  var font: UIFont
    
    /// text color
    public  var foregroundColor: UIColor
    
    /// text alignment
    public  var textAlignments: NSTextAlignment
    
    /// bubble's presentaion animation which is (bounce + fade-in), do you want your bubbles have?
    public  var hasAppearAnimation: Bool
    
    /// distance between the bubble and the target view
    public  var padding: UIEdgeInsets = .zero
    
    /// whole hint(dim and bubble) should be dismiss when user is touched on the target area
    public  var dismissOnTargetAreaTap: Bool
    
    /// will execute when user taps on target area
    public var onTargetAreaTap : TapGesture?
    
    /// each hint could has a different dim color which is viewable in the animation(sun and moon)
    public var changeDimColor : UIColor?
    
    /// will execute when user taps on the bubble
    public var onBubbleTap : TapGesture?
    
}
```

## Actions
TipSee has four actions which we can react to them to handle some situations 
  1. **Bubble.onBubbleTap** when user clicks on the bubble view, we can access to tapped bubble and item 
  2. **Bubble.onTargetAreaTap** when user click on target area
  3. **HintObject.onDimTap** when user clicks on dim(background), we can access to latest hint on the screen 
  4. **HintObject.onBubbleTap** when user clicks on bubble, this is default action if the bubble has not specified one for itself

## Tip Lifecycle 
based on what we set for **bubbleLiveDuration** in options, tips have a life duration which means that tips should be on the screen until user taps on them to dismiss or should be removed  before new one is appearing 

## How To Use
first thing is setuping your option (or using default option) and then creating a new instance of TipSee
```swift 
  let defaultTipOption = TipSee.Options
			.default()
			.with {
				$0.dimColor =  UIColor.black.withAlphaComponent(0.3)
				$0.bubbleLiveDuration = .untilNext
				$0.dimFading = false
	}
  
  // TipSee needs a window to show it's content in it
  let tipsee = TipSee(on: self.view.window!)
  
  // shows a simple text(tip) that is pointed to the view(pugImage), this tip has not specific configuration
  // so it will use default one
	tipSee.show(for: self.pugImage, text: "good boy")
  ```
  
  or you can create a custom tip with customized configuration 
```swift 
  // creates new custom item with custom configs
  let pugLoveConfig = TipSee.Options.Bubble
        .default()
        .with{
            $0.backgroundColor = .clear
            $0.foregroundColor = .black
            $0.textAlignments = .left
            $0.padding = UIEdgeInsets.init(top: 0, left: 16, bottom: 0, right: 16)
            $0.position = .top
        }
  tipSee.show(item TipSee.TipItem.init(ID: "100", pointTo: self.pugImage, contentView: image,bubbleOptions: pugLoveConfig))
  
```

in above exmaple wee need to handle tip sequence ourselves. next, previous, presenting or dismissing should be handled by using the actions like bubble tap, target area tap, dimtap and ... but there is a slideshow extension which we talk in neext section that helps us with these things.

## TipSeeManager
TipSee manager is a helper class that gives us the ability to have a slideshow like Tips. this manager handles tips array and provides handy apis (next, previous). we can add tips as many as we want and then start the sequence by calling **.next()**

```swift
let defaultTipOption = TipSee.Options
			.default()
			.with {
				$0.dimColor =  UIColor.black.withAlphaComponent(0.3)
				$0.bubbleLiveDuration = .untilNext
				$0.dimFading = false
		}
				
 let tipManager = TipcManager(on: self.view.window!,with: defaultTipOption)
 tipManager.add(new: TipSee.TipItem.init(ID: "100", pointTo: self.pugImage, contentView: image,bubbleOptions: pugLoveConfig))       
 tipManager.add(new: self.pugImage,text:"best dog ever <3 <3 ^_^ ^_^",with: pugDescriptionConfig.with{$0.position = .right})
 tipManager.add...
 ...
 ...
 ...
 
 tipManager.next()

```
