## Requirements
iOS 8.0+

## CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
```	
$ gem install cocoapods
```

### For Swift 3
```
You can use > 1.0.4
```
### For Swift 2.3
```
Please use 1.0.3
```

To integrate ASToast into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'ASToast', '~> 1.0.7'
end
```
Then, run the following command:
```
$ pod install
```
## Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

```
brew update
brew install carthage
```

To integrate ASToast into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```
github "abdullahselek/ASToast" ~> 1.0.7
```

Run carthage update to build the framework and drag the built ASToast.framework into your Xcode project.

customView.autoresizingMask = [UIViewAutoresizing.flexibleLeftMargin, UIViewAutoresizing.flexibleRightMargin, UIViewAutoresizing.flexibleTopMargin, UIViewAutoresizing.flexibleBottomMargin]
customView.backgroundColor = UIColor.green

self.view.showToast(toastView: customView,
					duration: TimeInterval(3.0),
					position: .bottom)
```

Show an imageView as toast, on center at point (110,110)
```
let toastImageView: UIImageView! = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "apple_logo"))
